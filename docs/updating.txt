# Wolf CMS - INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING


## GENERAL ##

Please be aware that we only support single version upgrades.

IMPORTANT - always check your security by viewing security.php post update!



### Upgrading from 0.7.5-sp1 => 0.7.6 or 0.7.7 ###

IMPORTANT - Make absolutely sure you have 0.7.5-sp1 before doing this.
(due to a bug in the 0.7.6 release, it is advised to upgrade to 0.7.7)

You can upgrade from 0.7.5-sp1 by simply replacing the Wolf CMS files. No database changes required.
Make sure you have a backup of your files though.

Upgrade Notes:

1. If you see "MISSING_DEFAULT_STRING", it means that no "translation" was found for a string in en-message.php

This is most likely caused by either a missing translation string or a missing en-message.php file for a plugin.

2. Without knowing your layouts and snippets, if you have references to "$this->url" in your navigation related code,
   you should probably change it into "$this->path()". That should fix potential problems with highlighting the active page in your
   menu for example.


### Upgrading from 0.7.x => 0.7.5 (ONLY!) ###

IMPORTANT - Make absolutely sure you have 0.7.x before doing this.

1. Create a backup of your files AND database. Save your config.php file!

2. Login to your old installation and disable ALL of your plugins.

3. Delete everything from your old Wolf installation. (Make sure you did step 1!)
    - You can leave your public directory in place.

4. Extract the 0.7.5 download as if you would install it normally.

5. Make sure to rename the "_.htaccess" file if desired and check its settings against your backup.

6. Copy your OLD config.php into your 0.7.5 installation, overwriting the empty default.

7. Copy back your third party plugins.

8. Execute the following SQL on your database.

INSERT INTO permission (id, name) VALUES (26, 'backup_restore_view')
INSERT INTO role_permission (role_id, permission_id) VALUES (1, 26)
INSERT INTO role_permission (role_id, permission_id) VALUES (2, 26)

9. Re-enable and test each plugin one by one.
   (make sure you at least re-enable the File Manager and Archive plugins to enable their new settings)

10. Test your upgraded installation.
