# Wolf CMS - INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING


## GENERAL ##

Please be aware that we only support single version upgrades.

IMPORTANT - always check your security by viewing security.php post update!


### Upgrading from 0.6.0 => 0.7.0 ###

IMPORTANT - Make absolutely sure you have 0.6.0 before doing this.

1. Create a backup of your files AND database. Save your config.php file!

2. Login to your old installation and disable all of your plugins.

3. Delete everything from your old Wolf installation. (Make sure you did step 1!)
    - You can leave your public directory in place.

4. Extract the 0.7.0 download as if you would install it normally.

5. Make sure to rename the "_.htaccess" file if desired and check its settings against your backup.

6. Copy your OLD config.php into your 0.7.0 installation, overwriting the empty default.

7. Visit http://www.example.com/wolf/install/index.php and follow the instructions to upgrade your database.

8. Visit http://www.example.com/security.php to view the security advisory.

9. Test your new installation.

10. Copy back your third party plugins.

11. Enable and test each third party plugin one by one.
