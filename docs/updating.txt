# Wolf CMS - INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING


## GENERAL ##

Please be aware that we only support single version upgrades.

IMPORTANT - always check your security by viewing security.php post update!


### Upgrading from 0.6.0 => 0.7.0 ###

IMPORTANT - Make absolutely sure you have 0.6.0 before doing this.

1. Create a backup of your files AND database. Save your config.php file!

2. Delete everything from your old Wolf installation. (Make sure you did step 1!)

3. Extract the 0.7.0 download as if you would install it normally.

4. Make sure to rename the "_.htaccess" file if desired and check its settings.

5. Copy your OLD config.php into your 0.7.0 installation, overwriting the empty default.

6. Visit http://www.example.com/wolf/install/index.php and follow the instructions to upgrade your database.

7. Visit http://www.example.com/security.php to view the security advisory.

8. Test your new installation.

9. Clean up by removing the wolf/install & docs directories as well as readme.txt and security.php
