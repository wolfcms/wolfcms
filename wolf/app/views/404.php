   - Unfortunately, Microsoft added a clever 'feature' to Internet Explorer. 
   - If the text of an error's message is 'too small', specifically less than 512 bytes, 
   - Internet Explorer returns its own error message. You can turn that off, but it's 
   - tricky to find. This comment serves as padding to prevent that behaviour in IE.
